# RCodeSpace
This is the R Code Space for:

1. Fundamental microbial ecology research based on amplicon sequencing, which includes:

  1) what we need to do when we get the raw sequences from the sequencing company;
  2) how to process the raw data to get a neat ASV table;
  3) what kind of analyses we can do to generate an overview of our microbial community data;
  4) the new fancy plots that draw the reader's attention and focus on the scientific points.

2. Commonly used codes for plotting complex data, such as:
   
  1) complex heatmap plot for multiple variables;
  2) circus plot for treatments that include hierarchical factors;
  3) Sankey plot for dynamics during observation;
  4) Random forest and other modeling plots.
